            <p>Now that's out of the way: <b>Welcome to my e-Portfolio! </b> This e-Portfolio was created for the Reflection-tier module in the University Scholars Program. This e-Portfolio highlights and showcases just three learning experiences I’ve had in my four years of education in NUS and USP.</p>
            <p>I'm a multi-disciplinary interactive media student who loves making things. For this e-Portfolio, my theme is the same as that of the module: Intellectual Responsibility in a Complex World. Why?</p>
            <p>I feel that these words capture many facets of my university education. In my four years here, I've been exposed to many kinds of thinking. Intellectual is one of them, and arguably the one I've been exposed to the most. Now that I am leaving university, equipped with knowledge, skills, these modes of thinking, and experience, how should I make use of them? </p>
            <p>I hope that this e-Portfolio will showcase not just my experiences, but also how I will bring them forward.</p>

                Interacting with a complex world is hard as an individual. As a team, things get even more complex. In my first post, “Learning to Adapt on a Larger Scale”, I look at my experiences in software development and in art projects. Project management in a complex world means we have to always pay attention to feedback to know how we’re doing. Having a development cycle to iterate through, regardless of project type, helps us with that.
            </p><p class="text-left world2">
                One of my interests as an interactive media student is in how effective models are as feedback. For instance, in public transport, convincing people to take a multiple-bus route instead of one that relies on the MRT can be tough, even though data shows that it takes less time. As a group research project, we looked at an honour system in the USP and how people interacted with it using a game as a model. We then published the results as a website as feedback to the USP community. This website can be found here.

                Issues like racism and sexism are highly personal and it’s easy to get emotional when discussing these issues. But because I have been exposed to intellectual lenses, I can use them to re-frame the discussion, and offer more meaningful feedback. In my second post, “Depersonalising the Personal”, I talk about my experience with academia and my experience with being a female in computing, which is known to be a largely male-dominated field.

                My third post, “Making Good Art”, showcases what I’ve learnt as an artist, an interactive media student, a writer...generally, as a person who has to interact with other human beings. In my four years, I’ve consumed a lot of media – plays, films, books, poetry, games. I consider it my responsibility to think critically about , and provide feedback for the media I’ve interacted with and about the things I create and produce, so that I can make better art and communicate myself more genuinely.
