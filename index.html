                You are seated in a circle with three other strangers. <br>
                A box of ice-cream sticks will be passed around your group of four players for exactly one round. <br>
                When you receive the box of sticks, you can take as little or as many sticks from the box, and pass it on to the next person. <br>
                After the box has been passed around to every player once, your sticks will be collected and counted. <br><br>

                <b><i>As a group</i></b>, if you have collected <b>7 sticks or less in total</b>, no one will get a prize.<br>
                <b><i>As a group</i></b>, if you have collected <b>at least 8 sticks in total</b>, some players will qualify for a prize.<br><br>
              
              The person(s) with the least number of sticks will get a prize. The rest of the players will get nothing. </p>

                    <li>If 3 players are tied for least number of sticks, each winner gets $2.</li>
                    <li>If 2 players are tied for least number of sticks, each winner gets $3.</li>
                    <li>If 1 player collects the least number of sticks, he/she gets $6.</li></ul>
            <p class="text-faded text-left">After each round, the number of winners from the round will be announced. <br> The same activity will be repeated for three rounds.<br><br> </p>
